## Summary

Several critical engine core services lack test coverage, representing gaps in fundamental engine functionality verification.

## Affected Classes

- `TimeService` - No tests (timing and frame rate management)
- `WindowContext` - No tests (window management and lifecycle)
- `EngineServices` - No tests (service container and dependency injection)
- `Game` interface - No tests (core game abstraction)
- `GlfwContext` - No tests (GLFW initialization and management)

## Current State

- ❌ Engine initialization sequence untested
- ❌ Service lifecycle management unverified
- ❌ Window creation and management untested
- ❌ Timing and frame rate calculations untested
- ❌ Service container functionality untested

## Required Testing Strategy


### Test Types by Component

#### TimeService Tests (Unit + Integration)
**Unit Tests** (timing logic):
```java
class TimeServiceTest {
    @Test void deltaTimeCalculation_withValidFrames_isAccurate();
    @Test void frameRateCalculation_averagesCorrectly();
    @Test void timeScaling_affectsDeltaTime();
}
```

**Integration Tests** (real timing):
```java
class TimeServiceIT extends EngineTestHarness {
    @Test void realTimeProgress_measuresAccurately();
    @Test void frameRateThrottling_limitsCorrectly();
}
```

#### WindowContext Tests (Integration)
```java
class WindowContextIT extends EngineTestHarness {
    @Test void windowCreation_withValidParameters_succeeds();
    @Test void windowResize_triggersCallbacks();
    @Test void windowClose_cleansUpResources();
    @Test void fullscreenToggle_changesMode();
}
```

#### EngineServices Tests (Unit)
```java
class EngineServicesTest {
    @Test void serviceRegistration_storesCorrectly();
    @Test void serviceRetrieval_returnsRegisteredService();
    @Test void serviceOverride_replacesExisting();
    @Test void missingService_handlesGracefully();
}
```

#### Game Interface Tests (Contract)
```java
class GameInterfaceTest {
    @Test void gameLifecycle_definesRequiredMethods();
    @Test void gameImplementation_followsContract();
}
```

#### GlfwContext Tests (Integration)
```java
class GlfwContextIT extends EngineTestHarness {
    @Test void glfwInitialization_succeeds();
    @Test void contextCreation_withValidParams_works();
    @Test void errorCallback_handlesGlfwErrors();
    @Test void cleanup_terminatesCleanly();
}
```

## Specific Test Scenarios


### TimeService Testing
- [ ] Delta time calculation accuracy
- [ ] Frame rate measurement and averaging
- [ ] Time scaling for game pausing/slow-motion
- [ ] High precision timing for smooth gameplay
- [ ] Frame rate limiting functionality

### WindowContext Testing  
- [ ] Window creation with various configurations
- [ ] Window resize handling and callbacks
- [ ] Fullscreen/windowed mode switching
- [ ] Window close event handling
- [ ] OpenGL context creation and management

### EngineServices Testing
- [ ] Service registration and retrieval
- [ ] Singleton vs instance service management
- [ ] Service dependency resolution
- [ ] Service lifecycle coordination
- [ ] Error handling for missing services

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Complete engine startup sequence
- [ ] Service initialization order
- [ ] Cross-service communication
- [ ] Graceful shutdown procedure

## Implementation Challenges


### Timing Tests
- Tests must account for system timing variations
- Use relative measurements rather than absolute
- Mock system clocks where appropriate
- Test timing logic separately from real-time behavior

### Window Management Tests
- Requires working GLFW context
- Must handle headless CI environment
- Test window states and properties
- Verify callback registration and execution

### Service Container Tests
- Test service lifetime management
- Verify dependency injection patterns
- Handle circular dependencies
- Test service replacement and mocking

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] TimeService has >80% test coverage
- [ ] WindowContext has >70% test coverage  
- [ ] EngineServices has >80% test coverage
- [ ] Game interface has contract tests
- [ ] GlfwContext has basic integration tests
- [ ] Engine startup sequence is tested end-to-end
- [ ] Service initialization order is verified
- [ ] Tests pass reliably in CI environment
