# GitHub Issues Summary - REVISED ANALYSIS

**IMPORTANT**: This analysis has been updated to reflect that many comprehensive tests already exist but are failing due to environment setup issues.

Generated 7 GitHub issues from revised testing analysis documentation.

## Key Finding
The original analysis was partly outdated because:
- Comprehensive integration tests exist for core systems (MovementSystemIT, RenderSystemIT, AudioSystemIT)
- Coverage shows 0% because tests fail to execute, not because tests don't exist
- Main issue is EngineTestHarness OpenGL/OpenAL context initialization in CI

## Revised Implementation Strategy

1. **Priority 1 (Critical)**: Fix EngineTestHarness and CI environment to enable existing tests
2. **Priority 2 (High/Medium)**: Add missing unit tests and enhance coverage
3. **Priority 3 (Low)**: Advanced features and optimization

The focus has shifted from "create all tests" to "fix test execution + fill specific gaps".
