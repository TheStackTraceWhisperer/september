## Summary

The `september.engine.audio` package has **1% test coverage**, with all three core audio classes essentially untested. This represents a significant gap in audio system verification.

## Affected Classes

- `AudioBuffer` - 0% coverage (144 missed instructions, 16 missed branches)
- `AudioSource` - 0% coverage (222 missed instructions, 32 missed branches)
- `AudioManager` - 4% coverage (227 missed instructions, 25 missed branches)

## Current State

- ❌ No unit tests for audio data management
- ❌ No integration tests for audio playback
- ❌ Audio resource lifecycle untested
- ❌ OpenAL integration completely unverified

## Required Testing Strategy


### Test Types Needed

#### Pure Logic Tests (AudioBuffer)
`AudioBuffer` manages audio data and should have harness-free unit tests:
- [ ] Buffer creation and resource management
- [ ] Data loading from byte arrays
- [ ] Resource cleanup (`AutoCloseable` contract)
- [ ] Error handling for invalid data

#### Integration Tests (AudioSource, AudioManager)
These classes require `EngineTestHarness` due to OpenAL dependencies:
- [ ] Audio source creation and configuration
- [ ] Playback state management (play, pause, stop)
- [ ] 3D positioning and attenuation
- [ ] Volume and pitch controls
- [ ] Multiple source management

### Specific Test Scenarios

#### AudioBuffer Tests
```java
class AudioBufferTest {
    @Test void creation_withValidData_succeeds();
    @Test void close_releasesNativeResources();
    @Test void creation_withInvalidData_throwsException();
}
```

#### AudioSource Integration Tests  
```java
class AudioSourceIT extends EngineTestHarness {
    @Test void playback_withValidBuffer_succeeds();
    @Test void positioning_updates3DLocation();
    @Test void volumeControl_affectsPlayback();
    @Test void multipleSourcesPlaySimultaneously();
}
```

#### AudioManager Integration Tests
```java
class AudioManagerIT extends EngineTestHarness {
    @Test void initialization_createsOpenALContext();
    @Test void sourceManagement_createsAndDestroysCorrectly();
    @Test void cleanup_releasesAllResources();
}
```

## Implementation Notes

- Follow existing audio test patterns in `AudioSystemIT.java`
- Mock external dependencies where appropriate (file I/O)
- Test resource management carefully (memory leaks)
- Verify OpenAL state changes where observable

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AudioBuffer has comprehensive unit test suite
- [ ] AudioSource has integration tests covering all public methods
- [ ] AudioManager has integration tests for lifecycle management
- [ ] Test coverage >70% for audio package
- [ ] Tests verify proper resource cleanup
- [ ] Tests pass in headless CI environment

## Dependencies

- Requires working `EngineTestHarness` for integration tests
- May need test audio files in `src/test/resources`

## 🚀 Implementation Coordination

**Task Force Assignment**: Available for assignment
**Dependencies**: EngineTestHarness, project testing infrastructure
**Estimated Effort**: Medium (2-4 weeks for experienced contributor)

### 📋 Getting Started
1. Read the [project testing guidelines](../TESTING.md)
2. Set up development environment with OpenGL/OpenAL support
3. Review existing test patterns in the codebase
4. Coordinate with other task forces for shared resources

### 🔗 Related Task Forces

- See other testing issues for shared patterns and dependencies

**Environment Setup**: `sudo apt-get install -y openjdk-21-jdk maven xvfb mesa-utils`
**Build Command**: `export MESA_GL_VERSION_OVERRIDE=4.6 && xvfb-run -a mvn verify`
