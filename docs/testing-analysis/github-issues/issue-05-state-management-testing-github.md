## Summary  

The `september.engine.state` package has **13% test coverage**, with the critical `GameStateManager` having minimal test coverage and the `GameState` interface completely untested.

## Affected Classes

- `GameStateManager` - 13% coverage (53 missed instructions, 6 missed branches)
- `GameState` interface - No tests (interface definition)

## Current State

- ❌ State transition logic untested
- ❌ State lifecycle management unverified  
- ❌ State hierarchy and sub-state management untested
- ❌ Error handling during state transitions untested
- ❌ State cleanup and resource management unverified

## Architecture Context

The September engine uses a hierarchical FSM approach:
1. **Main FSM**: High-level states (Menu, Loading, Playing)
2. **Sub-FSM**: Within PlayingState (Exploring, Battle, Menu)

This critical system requires comprehensive testing to ensure proper game flow.

## Required Testing Strategy


### Test Types Needed

#### Interface Contract Tests
```java
class GameStateTest {
    @Test void stateLifecycle_followsCorrectPattern();
    @Test void stateInterface_definesRequiredMethods();
}
```

#### GameStateManager Integration Tests
```java
class GameStateManagerIT extends EngineTestHarness {
    @Test void stateTransition_updatesCurrentState();
    @Test void hierarchicalStates_manageSubStatesCorrectly();
    @Test void stateCleanup_releasesResourcesProperly();
    @Test void invalidTransition_handlesGracefully();
}
```

### Specific Test Scenarios

#### State Lifecycle Management
- [ ] State initialization and entry
- [ ] State update loop execution  
- [ ] State exit and cleanup
- [ ] Resource acquisition and release

#### State Transition Logic
- [ ] Valid state transitions succeed
- [ ] Invalid state transitions are blocked
- [ ] Transition callbacks execute correctly
- [ ] State history is maintained appropriately

#### Hierarchical State Management
- [ ] Parent state manages child states
- [ ] Sub-state transitions work correctly
- [ ] State stack operations (push/pop)
- [ ] State event propagation

#### Error Handling and Edge Cases
- [ ] Null state handling
- [ ] Exception during state transition
- [ ] Resource cleanup on failure
- [ ] State restoration after errors

## Mock State Implementation

Create test states for comprehensive testing:

```java
// Test implementation classes
class TestMainMenuState implements GameState { }
class TestLoadingState implements GameState { }
class TestPlayingState implements GameState { }
class TestPauseState implements GameState { }

// Mock states for failure testing
class FailingState implements GameState {
    // Intentionally throws exceptions for error testing
}
```

## Implementation Notes


### Integration Test Strategy
- Use `EngineTestHarness` for engine context
- Create mock state implementations for testing
- Test both successful flows and error conditions
- Verify resource management and cleanup

### State Testing Patterns
- Test state transitions as behavior, not implementation
- Verify observable state changes
- Check resource acquisition/release
- Validate state machine invariants

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] GameState interface has contract tests
- [ ] GameStateManager has >80% test coverage
- [ ] All state lifecycle methods are tested
- [ ] State transition logic is comprehensively tested
- [ ] Hierarchical state management is verified
- [ ] Error handling and recovery is tested
- [ ] Resource cleanup is validated
- [ ] Tests support future state implementations

## Future Extensibility

Tests should be designed to:
- Support additional state types
- Handle new state machine features
- Validate state persistence/restoration
- Test performance characteristics
