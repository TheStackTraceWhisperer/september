## Summary

The `september.engine.systems` package has **0% test coverage** across all three core systems. This represents a critical gap in testing core engine functionality.

## Affected Classes

- `AudioSystem` - 0% coverage (641 missed instructions, 74 missed branches)
- `MovementSystem` - 0% coverage (133 missed instructions, 12 missed branches)  
- `RenderSystem` - 0% coverage (82 missed instructions, 2 missed branches)

## Current State

- ❌ No unit tests exist for any system class
- ❌ Integration tests fail due to engine initialization issues
- ❌ System behavior completely unverified

## Required Testing Strategy


### Integration Tests (Primary)
All systems require `EngineTestHarness`-based integration tests as they interact with:
- OpenGL context (RenderSystem)
- OpenAL context (AudioSystem)  
- ECS World (all systems)

### Test Scenarios Needed

#### AudioSystem
- [ ] Audio component lifecycle management
- [ ] Music vs sound effect handling
- [ ] Audio source creation and cleanup
- [ ] Background music state management
- [ ] Multiple sound effect playback

#### MovementSystem  
- [ ] Entity movement with diagonal input
- [ ] Entity movement with straight-line input
- [ ] No movement when no input provided
- [ ] Previous position tracking
- [ ] Movement speed calculations

#### RenderSystem
- [ ] Sprite rendering with transforms
- [ ] Mesh rendering with materials
- [ ] Camera projection and view matrices
- [ ] Multiple entity rendering
- [ ] Resource cleanup on system shutdown

## Implementation Notes

- Follow existing patterns in `MovementSystemIT.java` template
- Use real `IWorld` from harness, mock external services (TimeService, etc.)
- Verify observable outcomes, not method calls
- Test both positive flows and edge cases

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Each system has comprehensive integration test suite
- [ ] Test coverage >80% for all three system classes
- [ ] Tests pass in CI environment with `xvfb-run`
- [ ] Tests follow project's testing philosophy (behavior over implementation)

## 🚀 Implementation Coordination

**Task Force Assignment**: Available for assignment
**Dependencies**: EngineTestHarness, project testing infrastructure
**Estimated Effort**: Medium (2-4 weeks for experienced contributor)

### 📋 Getting Started
1. Read the [project testing guidelines](../TESTING.md)
2. Set up development environment with OpenGL/OpenAL support
3. Review existing test patterns in the codebase
4. Coordinate with other task forces for shared resources

- See other testing issues for shared patterns and dependencies

**Environment Setup**: `sudo apt-get install -y openjdk-21-jdk maven xvfb mesa-utils`
**Build Command**: `export MESA_GL_VERSION_OVERRIDE=4.6 && xvfb-run -a mvn verify`
