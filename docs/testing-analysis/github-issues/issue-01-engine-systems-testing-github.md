<!-- IMPORTANT: Analysis updated to reflect that many tests exist but fail due to environment issues -->

> **⚠️ REVISED ANALYSIS**: This issue has been updated to reflect the current reality that substantial test infrastructure already exists but is failing to execute due to environment setup issues.

> **Note**: This is part of the September Engine Testing Task Force initiative. See [Testing Analysis Documentation](../docs/testing-analysis/) for coordination details.


## Summary

The `september.engine.systems` package has **0% test coverage** across all three core systems. This represents a critical gap in testing core engine functionality.

## Affected Classes

- `AudioSystem` - 0% coverage (641 missed instructions, 74 missed branches)
- `MovementSystem` - 0% coverage (133 missed instructions, 12 missed branches)  
- `RenderSystem` - 0% coverage (82 missed instructions, 2 missed branches)

## Current State

- ✅ Integration tests exist for all three systems (MovementSystemIT, RenderSystemIT, AudioSystemIT)
- ❌ Integration tests fail due to OpenGL/OpenAL context initialization issues in CI
- ❌ Tests show 0% coverage because they cannot execute, not because they don't exist
- ✅ Test code is comprehensive and well-written

## Required Testing Strategy


### Fix Test Execution Environment (Primary)
The main issue is that comprehensive integration tests exist but fail to execute:
- Fix OpenGL context initialization in CI environment
- Resolve OpenAL context setup issues
- Ensure `EngineTestHarness` works properly in headless mode

### Existing Test Coverage
**Tests that exist but fail to run:**
- `MovementSystemIT.java` - Tests entity movement with diagonal and straight-line input
- `RenderSystemIT.java` - Tests sprite rendering without errors
- `AudioSystemIT.java` - Comprehensive audio component testing

### Test Scenarios Needed

#### Fix Existing Tests (Priority 1)
- [ ] Resolve EngineTestHarness OpenGL context initialization
- [ ] Fix CI environment compatibility for graphics tests
- [ ] Ensure AudioSystemIT can run in headless mode
- [ ] Debug and fix MovementSystemIT execution
- [ ] Debug and fix RenderSystemIT execution

#### Additional Test Coverage (Priority 2)  
- [ ] Unit tests for system logic that doesn't require graphics context
- [ ] Edge case testing for each system
- [ ] Performance testing for system update loops

## Implementation Notes

- Follow existing patterns in `MovementSystemIT.java` template
- Use real `IWorld` from harness, mock external services (TimeService, etc.)
- Verify observable outcomes, not method calls
- Test both positive flows and edge cases

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All existing integration tests execute successfully in CI environment
- [ ] EngineTestHarness properly initializes OpenGL/OpenAL contexts
- [ ] Test coverage >80% for all three system classes (currently 0% due to execution failures)
- [ ] Tests pass reliably with `xvfb-run -a mvn verify`
- [ ] Any additional unit tests follow project's testing philosophy
- [ ] Fix root cause of "Engine initialization failed" errors

## 🚀 Implementation Coordination

**Task Force Assignment**: Available for assignment
**Dependencies**: Working CI environment, EngineTestHarness fixes
**Estimated Effort**: High (1-2 weeks - requires deep debugging of test harness)

### 📋 Getting Started
1. Read the [project testing guidelines](../TESTING.md)
2. Set up development environment with OpenGL/OpenAL support
3. Investigate EngineTestHarness initialization issues
4. Review existing test code before adding new tests

### 🔗 Related Task Forces
- Check [Testing Task Force Summary](../docs/testing-analysis/task-force-summary.md) for coordination
- Many issues share the same EngineTestHarness root cause

**Environment Setup**: `sudo apt-get install -y openjdk-21-jdk maven xvfb mesa-utils`
**Build Command**: `export MESA_GL_VERSION_OVERRIDE=4.6 && xvfb-run -a mvn verify`
**Current Issue**: Integration tests fail with "Engine initialization failed"
