- **Missing tests**: TimeService, WindowContext, EngineServices

#### 7. september.engine.rendering.gl (32% coverage)
- **Missing tests**: InstancedOpenGLRenderer, InstancedShaderSources
- Some good coverage for basic GL classes

#### 8. september.engine.rendering (46% coverage)
- **Missing tests**: InstancedMesh, Material, Renderer interface

### âœ… Well-Tested Areas (50%+ coverage)

#### 9. september.engine.ecs (89% coverage)
- World and component management well-tested
- **Minor gaps**: SystemManager, interface definitions

#### 10. september.engine.ecs.components (60% coverage)
- Most component classes have tests
- **Missing**: SoundEffectComponent

#### 11. september.engine.core.preferences (82% coverage)
- **Minor gaps**: PropertyImpl, PreferencesServiceImpl

## Classes Completely Missing Tests

### Engine Core Infrastructure
- `TimeService` - Critical timing functionality
- `WindowContext` - Window management
- `EngineServices` - Service container
- `Game` interface - Core game abstraction
- `GlfwContext` - GLFW initialization

### Input System
- `GamepadService` - Gamepad abstraction
- `GlfwGamepadService` - GLFW gamepad implementation
- `GlfwInputService` - GLFW input implementation
- `InputService` - Input abstraction

### Audio System
- `AudioBuffer` - Audio data management
- `AudioManager` - Audio system coordination
- `AudioSource` - Audio source management

### Rendering System
- `InstancedMesh` - Instanced rendering support
- `Material` interface - Material abstraction
- `Renderer` interface - Renderer abstraction
- `InstancedOpenGLRenderer` - Advanced OpenGL rendering
- `InstancedShaderSources` - Instanced shader management

### State Management
- `GameState` interface - State abstraction
- `GameStateManager` - State transition management

### Game Layer
- `PlayingState` - Main game state
- Various enum classes and type definitions

## Testing Strategy Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)

1. **Systems Package**: Create integration tests for all three core systems
2. **Audio Package**: Create unit and integration tests for audio components
3. **Input Package**: Create tests with mocked GLFW interactions
4. **Asset Package**: Expand ResourceManager tests, add AssetLoader tests

### Architecture Considerations

- **Integration vs Unit**: Follow project's preference for integration tests using EngineTestHarness
- **Native Dependencies**: Use strategic mocking for LWJGL/GLFW interactions where appropriate
- **Test Categories**:
  - **Harness-based**: For classes requiring OpenGL/OpenAL context
  - **Pure logic**: For data classes and pure business logic
  - **Strategic mocking**: For classes with external dependencies

### Test Implementation Plan

Each identified gap should become a separate GitHub issue to enable parallel development by different contributors ("task forks" as mentioned in the requirements).
