A starter template for an OpenGL Java application

## What's Included?

*   **Multi-Platform Support**: Write your code once and run it on Windows, macOS, and Linux. The project is already configured to handle the native dependencies for you.

*   **Modern Java 21**: Built on the latest Long-Term Support (LTS) version of Java, giving you access to modern language features and performance.

*   **Comprehensive Testing Suite**: Comes "ready for battle" with a full testing setup including Surefire, Failsafe, and JaCoCo. It starts with 100% code coverage to serve as a solid foundation for your own tests.

*   **Automated Release Pipeline**: A GitHub Actions workflow automatically builds, tests, and creates a GitHub Release every time you push to the `main` branch. It's really that simple: push your code, then download the build to share or play.
