# This Dockerfile creates a containerized CI/testing environment for the September game engine.
# It configures Ubuntu 24.04 with Java 21, Maven, and a virtual display (Xvfb) to enable
# headless execution of OpenGL and OpenAL dependent tests and applications.

FROM ubuntu:24.04
# Prevent interactive prompts during package installation
ARG DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive

# Install core dependencies for the September engine CI environment:
# - xvfb: Virtual X11 server for headless graphics testing
# - mesa-utils: Provides Mesa OpenGL drivers for software rendering
# - openjdk-21-jdk: Java 21 development kit (required by engine)
# - maven: Build tool for compiling and testing the Java project
# - ca-certificates: SSL certificate authorities for secure downloads
# - libopenal1: OpenAL audio library for 3D audio testing

# Disables certificate revocation checking to avoid network issues in CI environments
# where external certificate validation services may not be accessible.

# Override Mesa OpenGL version reporting for the September engine requirements.
# The engine requires OpenGL 4.6 support, but Mesa in CI environments may report
# a lower version even when 4.6 features are available. These overrides force
# Mesa to report version 4.6 with GLSL 460 support, enabling proper context creation.

# Configure OpenAL to use a null audio backend for headless testing.
# This provides complete OpenAL API compatibility while silently discarding all
# audio output, similar to how Xvfb provides headless graphics functionality.
# Essential for testing audio systems without requiring actual audio hardware.
